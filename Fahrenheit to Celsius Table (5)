  you must have public static void main but it can be something else also it could be public static blah blah blah 
  or it could be your name public static void "your name"
  this is generally used when you write big codes let's say for a bank or something
  then you would need so many void main so then you can write public static void let say simple interest
  now let's say you have a bug in the simple interest code that you have written
  it will become easy for you to find out*/
